/*
35% Weightage of fees score depends on Percentile of fees paid
35% Weightage of fees score depends fees paid with respect to amount spend
30% Weightage of fees score depends on the number of UTXOs present in the wallet.

Q : What role does W plays in the fees score?
Assume the wallet is being consolidated, Thus number of UTXO will decrease and thus 
W (Weightage of number of UTXO) will increase and this justifies that, consolidation 
increases the fees health since you donâ€™t overpay them in long run.
