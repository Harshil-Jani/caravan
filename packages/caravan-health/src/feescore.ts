Measure of how much the wallet is burning in fees is that we take the ratio of

35% Weightage of fees score depends on Percentile of fees paid

Q : What role does W plays in the fees score?
Assume the wallet is being consolidated, Thus number of UTXO will decrease and thus 
W (Weightage of number of UTXO) will increase and this justifies that, consolidation 
increases the fees health since you donâ€™t overpay them in long run.
